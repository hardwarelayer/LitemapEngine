#TienTN's Litemap Engine
=======================

Based on this project: https://github.com/hardwarelayer/PixiJSTilemap

I want to build a more "engine like" library on top of that.

So I have started this project.

This engine will be kept as a lite framework for tile-based map.

###Features:

* Separated data class

* Multiple containers / layers

* Clear event handling

* Multiple resource sources loading

###Deployment:

This only work with a local http server.
